### Some facts about me
I am 17 years old, studying at the 1503 School in the 11th grade. I have ended
the Yandex.Lyceum project, ending in one of the best students of the students' flow.
I love coding, love coffee and hate lack of time. It's exciting for me to find new relationships
in my workplace/office and talk a lot about themes, that don't even make sense. My core
strengths are fast-learning and adapting to any problems appearing in front of me.
